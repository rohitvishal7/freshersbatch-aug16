Reading Novel is one my Hobbies. Love to read fictions and autobiographies. Autobiographies let you know the insights of some of greatest struggles people have been through. It's motivating and inspiring. My favorite writes are Dan Brown, Amish Tripathi etc

Writing Computer programs is another. You have seen the craze for learning code. But what exactly is coding? Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website they are all made with code.
